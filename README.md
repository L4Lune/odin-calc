# odin-calc

Function for:
* Addition (done)
* Subtraction (done)
* Multiplication (done)
* Division (done)


* Operate (done-ish, will likely need to be reworked once I test this out)
If operator = + do add, if operator = - do subtract etc

Variables for firstNum, operator, and secondNum (done)

Create html calc buttons and get it all lined up
- 0-9, +, -, *, /, =, Clear, ., and a display

JavaScript:
 * Create functions to update the display on num click
    * This should be stored in a variable when a user presses the operator
    *
